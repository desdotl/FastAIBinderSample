If you're doing (say) image classification, then you'll normally be classifying just one user's image at a time, and there isn't normally enough work to do in a single image to keep a GPU busy for long enough for it to be very efficient. So, a CPU will often be more cost-effective.\n",
        "- An alternative could be to wait for a few users to submit their images, and then batch them up and process them all at once on a GPU. But then you're asking your users to wait, rather than getting answers straight away! And you need a high-volume site for this to be workable. If you do need this functionality, you can use a tool such as Microsoft's [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime), or [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\n",

        "You may well want to deploy your application onto mobile devices, or edge devices such as a Raspberry Pi. There are a lot of libraries and frameworks that allow you to integrate a model directly into a mobile application. However, these approaches tend to require a lot of extra steps and boilerplate, and do not always support all the PyTorch and fastai layers that your model might use. In addition, the work you do will depend on what kind of mobile devices you are targeting for deployment—you might need to do some work to run on iOS devices, different work to run on newer Android devices, different work for older Android devices, etc. Instead, we recommend wherever possible that you deploy the model itself to a server, and have your mobile or edge application connect to it as a web service.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are quite a few upsides to this approach. The initial installation is easier, because you only have to deploy a small GUI application, which connects to the server to do all the heavy lifting. More importantly perhaps, upgrades of that core logic can happen on your server, rather than needing to be distributed to all of your users. Your server will have a lot more memory and processing capacity than most edge devices, and it is far easier to scale those resources if your model becomes more demanding. The hardware that you will have on a server is also going to be more standard and more easily supported by fastai and PyTorch, so you don't have to compile your model into a different form.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are downsides too, of course. Your application will require a network connection, and there will be some latency each time the model is called. (It takes a while for a neural network model to run anyway, so this additional network latency may not make a big difference to your users in practice. In fact, since you can use better hardware on the server, the overall latency may even be less than if it were running locally!) Also, if your application uses sensitive data then your users may be concerned about an approach which sends that data to a remote server, so sometimes privacy considerations will mean that you need to run the model on the edge device (it may be possible to avoid this by having an *on-premise* server, such as inside a company's firewall). Managing the complexity and scaling the server can create additional overhead too, whereas if your model runs on the edge devices then each user is bringing their own compute resources, which leads to easier scaling with an increasing number of users (also known as *horizontal scaling*)."

        "> A: I've had a chance to see up close how the mobile ML landscape is changing in my work. We offer an iPhone app that depends on computer vision, and for years we ran our own computer vision models in the cloud. This was the only way to do it then since those models needed significant memory and compute resources and took minutes to process inputs. This approach required building not only the models (fun!) but also the infrastructure to ensure a certain number of \"compute worker machines\" were absolutely always running (scary), that more machines would automatically come online if traffic increased, that there was stable storage for large inputs and outputs, that the iOS app could know and tell the user how their job was doing, etc. Nowadays Apple provides APIs for converting models to run efficiently on device and most iOS devices have dedicated ML hardware, so that's the strategy we use for our newer models. It's still not easy but in our case it's worth it, for a faster user experience and to worry less about servers. What works for you will depend, realistically, on the user experience you're trying to create and what you personally find is easy to do. If you really know how to run servers, do it. If you really know how to build native mobile apps, do that. There are many roads up the hill.\n",

There isn't really a complete technical solution to this problem; instead, we have to be careful about our approach to rolling out the technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are other reasons we need to be careful too. One very common problem is *domain shift*, where the type of data that our model sees changes over time. For instance, an insurance company may use a deep learning model as part of its pricing and risk algorithm, but over time the types of customers that the company attracts, and the types of risks they represent, may change so much that the original training data is no longer relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Out-of-domain data and domain shift are examples of a larger problem: that you can never fully understand the entire behaviour of your neural network. They have far too many parameters to be able to analytically understand all of their possible behaviors. This is the natural downside of their best feature—their flexibility, which enables them to solve complex problems where we may not even be able to fully specify our preferred solution approaches. The good news, however, is that there are ways to mitigate these risks using a carefully thought-out process. The details of this will vary depending on the details of the problem you are solving, but we will attempt to lay out here a high-level approach, summarized in <<deploy_process>>, which we hope will provide useful guidance."

        "Where possible, the first step is to use an entirely manual process, with your deep learning model approach running in parallel but not being used directly to drive any actions. The humans involved in the manual process should look at the deep learning outputs and check whether they make sense. For instance, with our bear classifier a park ranger could have a screen displaying video feeds from all the cameras, with any possible bear sightings simply highlighted in red. The park ranger would still be expected to be just as alert as before the model was deployed; the model is simply helping to check for problems at this point.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second step is to try to limit the scope of the model, and have it carefully supervised by people. For instance, do a small geographically and time-constrained trial of the model-driven approach. Rather than rolling our bear classifier out in every national park throughout the country, we could pick a single observation post, for a one-week period, and have a park ranger check each alert before it goes out.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, gradually increase the scope of your rollout. As you do so, ensure that you have really good reporting systems in place, to make sure that you are aware of any significant changes to the actions being taken compared to your manual process. For instance, if the number of bear alerts doubles or halves after rollout of the new system in some location, we should be very concerned. Try to think about all the ways in which your system could go wrong, and then think about what measure or report or picture could reflect that problem, and ensure that your regular reporting includes that information."

        "> J: I started a company 20 years ago called _Optimal Decisions_ that used machine learning and optimization to help giant insurance companies set their pricing, impacting tens of billions of dollars of risks. We used the approaches described here to manage the potential downsides of something going wrong. Also, before we worked with our clients to put anything in production, we tried to simulate the impact by testing the end-to-end system on their previous year's data. It was always quite a nerve-wracking process, putting these new algorithms into production, but every rollout was successful."
